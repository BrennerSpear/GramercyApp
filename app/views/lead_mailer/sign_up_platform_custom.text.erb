So you don't use an eCommerce platform?



Gramercyâ€™s beta is launching in the Bigcommerce app store first, and will then launch in other eCommerce platform app stores.
        
In the future, we will do integrations on custom web storefronts.

If you are ADAMANT that your brand would like to use Gramercy's services sooner than the current ambigous timeline, please respond to this email so we may discuss.
