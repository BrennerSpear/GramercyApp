Get store credit to <%= @brand_name %>!

<%= @brand_name %> would like to send you a coupon for store credit when you Instagram the product you just bought from them!

<%= @brand_name %> is offering you:

<%= @cpl %>¢ per like you get on the post
and
$<%= sprintf('%.2f' % @dpf) %> per new follower you refer to their Instagram from your post

You will have <%= @dtp %> days from your date of purchase to post.

<%= @brand_name %>’s Instagram username is @<%= @brand_ig %>.

<%= @brand_name %> has set the maximum for a single coupon at $<%= sprintf('%.2f' % @max_coupon) %>. No matter the amount of engagement you get on your Instagram post, the coupon amount will not exceed $<%= sprintf('%.2f' % @max_coupon) %>.

A few things to remember:

-You will need to tag @<%= @brand_ig %> in your post to receive the coupon. (This means in the photo itself, not in the caption. Only the photo’s tags will be checked)
-72 hours after you post, we will send you the coupon.
-You may only receive a coupon from your the first Instagram you post that tags <%= @brand_name %>. You may only receive one coupon per online purchase from <%= @brand_name %>.
- You must have a product(s) from <%= @brand_name %> in your Instagram post, and the post must be in favorable light. The photo must be taken by you or a friend, meaning that you must have permission to use the photo.
- <%= @brand_name %> reserves the right to revoke coupon for reasons including but not limited to: belief the photo and its origins were not posted in good faith.
- You may not buy or acquire likes on your photo in any non-organic way, including but not limited to: buying likes or participating in like-for-like programs. You may not buy or acquire new followers for <%= @brand_name %>’s Instagram account in any non-organic way, including but not limited to: buying followers or participating in follow-for-follow programs.
